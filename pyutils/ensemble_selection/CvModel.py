    This is the class for a cross validated model as discussed in
    Caruana's paper.

    Example Usage:

        # To instantiate a model, input the following:
        # nfolds: The number of cross-validation folds.
        # trans: Input preprocessor object. It should have a tranform method.
        # clf: A classifier template that has a fit and predict method.

        cv_model = CvModel(n_folds, trans, clf)

        # Fit the model with training data X and labels y.
        cv_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Predict in sample labels. Note that this method is only valid for the
        # same X_train passed into the fit method.
        cv_model.hill_predict(X_train)

        # Predict out of sample labels. This could be any X_test.

        Train the cross-validated model using the training data X and y.

        Input:

            X: ndarray of shape (n_training_examples, # features).

            The ith model in the list is the model trained using all but
